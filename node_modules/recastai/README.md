# Recast.AI - SDK Node.js
Recast.AI official SDK in Node.js

## Synospis

This module is a wrapper around the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai/) [API](https://man.recast.ai/) API, and allows you to:
* [Analyse your text](https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-NodeJS/wiki/Analyse-text)
* [Manage your conversation](https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-NodeJS/wiki/Manage-your-conversation)
* [Receive and send messages](https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-NodeJS/wiki/Receive-and-send-messages)

## Installation

Install the package using npm, as shown below:
```bash
npm install --save recastai
```

You can now use the SDK in your code.

#### ES5

Using the entire SDK:
```js
var recastai = require('recastai').default

var client = new recastai('YOUR_TOKEN')
```

Extracting one single API:
```js
var recastai = require('recastai').default

var converse = new recastai.converse('YOUR_TOKEN')
```

#### ES6

Using the entire SDK:
```js
import recastai from 'recastai'

const client = new recastai('YOUR_TOKEN')
```

Extracting one single API:
```js
import { converse } from 'recastai'

const clientConverse = new converse('YOUR_TOKEN')
```

## Sample projects
